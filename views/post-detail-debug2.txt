In the following section of the handlebar for comments list, I would like
to enclose each comment entry in a box with a border:

{{#if comments.length}}
    <div class="comment-list">
      <h3>Current comments:</h3>

      {{#each comments as |comment|}}
      <div class="comment-item">
        <p class="comment-content">{{comment.content}}</p>
        <p class="comment-meta">Posted by {{comment.user.name}} on {{format_date comment.date_created}}</p>
      </div>
      {{/each}}
    </div>
  {{/if}}
</div>

Specification:
1. Enclose <p class="comment-content">{{comment.content}}</p> in a box with border
2. Enclose <p class="comment-meta">Posted by {{comment.user.name}} on {{format_date comment.date_created}}</p> also 
in a box with border, but attached to the comment.content box above it

This provides an overall enclosing box that includes the content on top and a bar of sort at the bottom of it
where the "Posted by username on given date" is displayed

Perhaps a Card with yet another enclosing Card could be used to achieve this?

Yes, you can achieve the desired layout by using Bootstrap's card components. Here's how you can modify 
the Handlebars template to enclose each comment in a card with a border:

{{#if comments.length}}
  <div class="comment-list">
    <h3>Current comments:</h3>

    {{#each comments as |comment|}}
    <div class="card mb-3">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text comment-content">{{comment.content}}</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card-footer comment-meta">
        Posted by {{comment.user.name}} on {{format_date comment.date_created}}
      </div>
    </div>
    {{/each}}
  </div>
{{/if}}

In this updated template:

1. Each comment is wrapped in a <div class="card mb-3"> element, which creates a card with a border 
and some bottom margin for spacing.

2. The comment content is placed inside a <div class="card-body"> element, which provides padding 
and styles the content area.

3. The comment metadata (username and date) is placed inside a <div class="card-footer comment-meta"> 
element, which creates a footer section for the card.

You can further customize the appearance of the cards by adding additional CSS styles. 

For example, you can change the border color, background color, or add shadows to the cards.

Here's an example of how you can style the cards using CSS:
.card {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.card-footer {
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  border-top: 1px solid #ccc;
  font-size: 0.9em;
  color: #666;
}

This CSS adds a light border, a subtle box shadow, and a slightly different background color for 
the card footer. You can adjust these styles to match your desired design.

With this approach, each comment will be displayed in a separate card with a border, and the 
comment content will be separated from the metadata by a footer section. This layout provides a 
clear visual separation between comments and makes it easier for users to distinguish individual comments.
