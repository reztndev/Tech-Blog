    <!-- Note: As per Mark, (/models/Post.js) was modified by commenting out the following line:
    >> //timestamps: false.  
    This means that Sequalize is now auto generating the timestamp.  As such, the following line was
    also removed from the (post.js):
    >> // date_created
    This is because we are allowing Sequalize to generated the timestamp.
    Finally, the following original line in this file updated to 
    >> post.date_created  was changged to post.createdAt:
    <p>Posted by {{post.user.name}} on {{format_date post.date_created}}</p>

    <p>Posted by {{post.user.name}} on {{format_date post.createdAt}}</p> -->

    <!-- Restored given the undefined date object issue in format_date function -->
    <p>Posted by {{post.user.name}} on {{format_date post.date_created}}</p>
